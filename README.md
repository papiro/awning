# awning
awning is a work-in-progress to become a massively scalable, impossibly secure, minimalist web server.

## Notes
currently awning is being developed specifically for usage in a POSIX environment.  Care is being taken so that a future port to Windows by someone will be easier.

#### Features
- middleware engine allowing pluggable and asynchronous middleware functions
- easy integration of REST services

### TODO
- multi-core the web-servers
- implement "beneficent load responsiveness"
